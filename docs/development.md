# Development Guidelines for the Interactive Terminal Project

## Introduction
This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the Interactive Terminal project. It includes coding standards, best practices, and instructions for setting up the development environment.

## Coding Standards
1. **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code. Ensure that your code is clean, readable, and well-organized.
2. **Documentation**: All public classes and methods should have docstrings explaining their purpose and usage. Use reStructuredText format for consistency.
3. **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or decisions in the code.

## Development Practices
1. **Branching**: Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes. The naming convention for branches should be `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<bug-name>`.
2. **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made. Use the format: `type: short description` (e.g., `feat: add new command handler`).
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for any new features or changes. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd interactive-terminal
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests**: Ensure that all tests are passing before starting development.
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Contribution Process
1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in a feature branch.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are complete and tested, submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Additional Resources
- Refer to the [usage documentation](usage.md) for examples of how to use the interactive terminal.
- Check the [README.md](../README.md) for an overview of the project and additional setup instructions.

By following these guidelines, you will help maintain the quality and consistency of the Interactive Terminal project. Thank you for your contributions!
